This doesn't work anymore, spotify dropped the app support for ages now.

sp-webcontroller
================

Spotify (minimal) WebController allows you to control spotify from another device. It provides a web interface to perform very simple tasks.

Instructions:
-------------

* For running the spotify app you need to set up your account for spotify apps here: https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/#developer-account
* Then install the app like in this tutorial: https://github.com/spotify/apps-tutorial#installation.
* Run the app writing spotify:app:webcontroller on the search field.
* Copy and/or share your control url and you're done.

Known Bugs:
-------------
* No bugs reported yet :)

Disclaimer:
-------------
* I did this on a very short period of time and when i tried to submit the app for spotify they didn't think it was useful. I hope you disagree :)
* Fork and do whatever you want, but if you change the 'serverlocation' or anything like that the app will (probably) stop working.
